# packaging/homebrew/leetenum.rb — Homebrew formula for LeetEnum.
#
# Lives in the tap repo as Formula/leetenum.rb:
#
#   mkdir -p Formula
#   curl -fsSL -o Formula/leetenum.rb \
#     https://github.com/theleetsec/LeetSec-Tools/releases/download/v1.1.1/leetenum.rb
#   brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/leetenum.rb
#
# A copy is kept here so the formula is versioned alongside the code it
# installs; CI attaches the rendered formula to each release. A separate tap
# can be updated when HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN is configured.
#
# Design notes:
#   - LeetEnum is a bash program, so this is a source install with no compile
#     step. libexec holds the tree, bin/leetenum is a symlink, and leetenum.sh
#     resolves symlinks itself to find lib/.
#   - The Go tools are dependencies, not vendored. Homebrew already packages
#     most of them and keeping them separate means `brew upgrade` updates the
#     toolchain without touching the pipeline.
#   - massdns has no formula. `leetenum install` builds it, and the caveats say
#     so rather than the formula pretending DNS brute force works without it.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The Go-based recon tools that Homebrew does not package, plus massdns,
      are installed separately:

        leetenum install

      massdns is required for DNS resolution and brute force. Without it,
      phases 2 through 4 return nothing and LeetEnum says so at startup.

      Check the environment at any time with:

        leetenum doctor

      Screenshots (phase 9) need a Chromium build:

        brew install --cask chromium

      Configuration and cache live under:
        #{ENV.fetch("XDG_CONFIG_HOME", "~/.config")}/leetsec
        #{ENV.fetch("XDG_CACHE_HOME", "~/.cache")}/leetsec
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Three checks that need no network and no toolchain: the version banner,
    # help text, and that the symlinked entry point still locates lib/.
    assert_match "leetenum", shell_output("#{bin}/leetenum version")
    assert_match "PHASES",   shell_output("#{bin}/leetenum --help")

    # `doctor` exits non-zero when a required tool is absent — that is deliberate,
    # so it can be used as a CI gate — and puredns has no formula, so a fresh
    # install is expected to report it missing. Assert on the report, not the
    # status.
    report = shell_output("#{bin}/leetenum doctor 2>&1 || true")
